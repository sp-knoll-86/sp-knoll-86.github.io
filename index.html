                <p>I am Spencer Knoll and I am currently working toward becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer.  As I continue my education, the adventures ahead of me are innumerable and very exciting.  This is only the beginning for me as I aspire to learn Video Game Development as well.  My hope is to one day be able to fully support myself as a Web Developer as I venture in to video game design.</p>
                <p>Growing up in Topeka, Kansas I enjoyed playing several sports and the visual arts.  It wasn’t until High School that I found I was talented as a painter with both acrylic and water-based paints.  I haven’t produced anything in a while but I hope to return to painting one day.</p>
                <p>In 2005 I began my first semester at the University of Kansas.   It took me a number of years (and majors) before I finally graduated in 2011 with a Bachelors Degree in Art History.  That proved to be a very useful Degree as I immediately found work as a server/bartender at a local restaurant in Topeka.</p>
                <p>For the past three years I have been working at a Travel Agency but never felt very comfortable in the field and decided I wanted to figure out a career path.  Now, nothing I have typed so far would imply Web Development as a career but it is something that was always interesting to me, however, I never new where to start.  When I saw the opportunity to join the Coding Bootcamp offered by my Alma Mater, I could not turn down the opportunity to pursue Web Development and begin my path in this exciting world.</p>
